**tfmars** is the TensorFlow's implementation of Mobile-aware Convolutional Neural Network for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition, a sibling of [tfgarden](https://github.com/Shakshi3104/tfgarden).
In this repository, some CNN models implemented in tfgarden have been implemented as Attention insertable models. 
Also, **MarNASNets** has been implemented.

MARS means **M**obile-aware **A**ctivity **R**ecognition model**S**.
